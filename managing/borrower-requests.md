These are the items you are trying to borrow from another library.

* Awaiting Approval = Your library's requests that need final approval.
  * Options

  1. Approved - send

  * Some libraries are configured to allow patrons to place their own ILL requests.  The approval process allows staff to verify that an ILL request meets their library's ILL policies.

* Not Received = An item you library has requested has been shipped but has been in transit for longer than the owning library's "Days to supply."
  * Options
  1. Received
  2. Lost

* Not-Received/Overdue = An item you library has requested had a status of "Not received" and the owning library has changed the status of the item to "Not-Received/Overdue"
  * Options
  1. Received
  2. Lost
 * This indicates that the owning library has probably sent an overdue notice to your library.
