# Logging in


## Example logon

Go to your [ShareIt URL](#shareit-urls)
![Logon screen](.gitbook/assets/010.jpg)

Login with your ShareIt [username and password](#shareit-usernames-and-passwords)
![Username and password](.gitbook/assets/020.jpg)

A successfull login should look like this:

If you have trouble logging in, keep reading.

## ShareIt URLs

ShareIt requires that each library logs in from a specific URL.

The format for a ShareIt login URL is

```html
http://ksuc-agent.auto-graphics.com/mvc?cid=ksuc&lid=XXX&reset=over
```

The difference between one library's login and another's is that you have to substitute the XXX in the middle of the above URL with your library's OCLC organization symbol. If you do not know your library's OCLC organization symbol, it can be found at

[https://www.oclc.org/en/contacts/libraries.html](https://www.oclc.org/en/contacts/libraries.html)

## Next Search Catalog URL location

If you are a member of the Next consortium, you can find the ShareIt URL for your library on the left side of the home page in the staff client.

## URL Troubleshooting

If you attempt to log into ShareIt and you do not get the normal login window, you can usually overcome the problem by logging into this alternate URLs

The most common URL problem looks like this:

![Kansas Library Catalog](.gitbook/assets/040.jpg)

![Two input boxes](.gitbook/assets/050.jpg)

If you see either of these scenarios, you can try an alternative URL

```html
http://ksuc-agent.auto-graphics.com/mvc?cid=ksuc&lid=XXX&reset=force
```

The difference between this URL and the previous one is that the last part of the URL is changed from "over" to "force"
