## Requests

### Basic request

Once you find a title you want to borrow, click on the "Request this item" button to initiate a request.  This will bring up a request form:

Once a request has been submitted, [it must be approved](#approve-requests-after-they-are-made) in the "Request manager" module.

### Requesting multi-copies

If you need to borrow multiple copies of a title (maybe for a book-club or classroom use) you can request multiple copies of a title.

Once a request has been submitted, [it must be approved](#approve-requests-after-they-are-made) in the "Request manager" module.

### Approve requests after they are made

After requests have been made, staff need to approve the requests.  The approval process is built into the system because some libraries allow patron initiated ILL requests through ShareIt.  The approval process allows staff to review any requests before they are sent to other libraries to make sure the ILL request are in line with the borrowing library's ILL policies.
